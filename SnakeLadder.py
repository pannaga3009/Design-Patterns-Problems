"""
Designing a Snake and Ladder board game involves several components that should be 
designed for flexibility and modularity. To start with, it's crucial to gather
specific requirements and constraints to ensure that the design meets the 
expected functionality and can be easily extended or modified in the future.


Design Approach

Entities and Responsibilities:

Board: Represents the game board with configurable size and positions for snakes and ladders.
Player: Represents a player in the game, including their position and turn management.
Dice: Handles dice rolling to generate random numbers.
Game: Manages the game flow, turns, and interactions between players.
Design Patterns

Strategy Pattern: For handling different dice rolling strategies if needed 
(e.g., standard dice, custom dice with different number ranges).
Observer Pattern: To notify players about changes in the game state 
(e.g., when a playerâ€™s position changes).
Factory Pattern: For creating different types of snakes, ladders, and boards if 
variations are required.
Command Pattern: To handle player actions like rolling the dice or moving pieces, 
which allows for easy extension or modification of player actions.
Class Design

Board Class
Manages the layout of the board, including snakes and ladders.
Allows for configuration of board size and positions.

Player Class
Manages player position and turn.

Dice Class
Handles dice rolling.

Game Class
Manages the game flow and interactions.

    Key Points:
    Board: Manages the positions of snakes and ladders and provides the logic for moving players.
    Player: Represents a player, keeping track of their position on the board.
    Dice: Handles the randomness of dice rolls.
    Game: Manages the flow of the game, including player turns, movement, and checking for a winner.

    Design Patterns:
    Strategy Pattern could be applied if you want different dice rolling strategies.
    Observer Pattern could be useful if you want to notify players of changes, like when a player lands on a snake or ladder.
    Command Pattern could be applied to encapsulate player actions (like rolling the dice) and handle them uniformly.
